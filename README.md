Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
========================================
This file describes run_analysis.R script.
* Unzip the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and rename the folder with "data".
* Make sure the folder "data" and the run_analysis.R script are both in the current working directory.
* Use source("run_analysis.R") command in RStudio. 
* Two output files are generated in the current working directory:
  - merged_data.txt (7.9 Mb): it contains a data frame called cleanedData.
  - data_with_means.txt (220 Kb): it contains a data frame called result.
* Finally, use data <- read.table("data_with_means.txt") command in RStudio to read the file.
